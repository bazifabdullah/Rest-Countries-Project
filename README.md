## Overview

This a responsive web app that displays information about countries using <a href="https://restcountries.com/">REST Countries API</a>. Its a solution for a challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">Frontendmentor.io</a>. Built with React, it allows users to search for countries, filter by region, and view detailed information about each country. This project was built as part of my React learning journey to practice API fetching, Routing and State Management.
